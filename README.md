# add-wordpress-admin-user

If you lost your WordPress password, and you can't receive the link to reset it by email, upload this code to your WordPress root folder (public_html or htdocs), and run the code (<your-site>.com/add-wordpress-admin-user.php). This will create a new admin user inside your WordPress -> User: admin-alternative | Pass: New_Password_123!
  
This is the simplest possible way to solve the lost WordPress password problem.
